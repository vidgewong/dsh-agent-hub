/**
 * Package-owned invariant companion for the loop engine selection.

 * a managed block for an engine and reading it back must produce the same
 * engine, and the `in-process` engine must render an absent block (so the base
 * bundle's `agent-loop` row stays mounted). The companion asserts both against
 * the pure transform, binding the writer's inverse to the reader directly.
